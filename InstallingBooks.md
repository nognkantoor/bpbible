# Introduction #
BPBible will read books as distributed by the SWORD project. This page details how to install books for use with BPBible.

# Details #
The main download point for books is at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp.
When you download books, it is best to download the raw zip version (though
the others will work).

Now do one of the following:
  1. Drag the zip file onto BPBible.
  1. In the file menu, select Install Books..., and locate the zip file.

You can now select the installation directory to install it to somewhere
different, or view the information associated with the book before
installing it. Now press OK to install the book. The book should show up in
the list of available books.

You can install multiple files at once. Just drag them all onto BPBible, or
select them all in the file selector.

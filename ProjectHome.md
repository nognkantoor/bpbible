BPBible is a free flexible Bible Study tool. It is designed to be easy to use.

# Features #
## Bible application ##
> BPBible has many of the features you would expect in a Bible application - Bible, Commentary, and Dictionary support, Bible Search, Scripture tooltips, etc.

## Cross verse searching ##
> BPBible uses a proximity based search, rather than a verse-based search. This means that a search can cross verse boundaries, giving a more natural search. It also supports regular expressions and phrases.

## Flexible layout ##
> BPBible lets you rearrange your layout, and will remember your layout for you.

## Good module support ##
> Due to the use of the SWORD libraries, BPBible can read many modules. The main module repository is at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp

## Topic Management ##
> BPBible supports collecting the passages related to a topic into a list and then organising and commenting on those passages.

## Free ##
> BPBible is licensed under the GPL and is absolutely free.

## Uses open source technology ##
> BPBible uses open source technology including Python, wxPython and the SWORD project.
